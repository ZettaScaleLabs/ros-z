# Smoke-test the release workflow without cutting a real release.
#
# Pushes a temporary prerelease tag to trigger the full release workflow
# (build → smoke-test → release), waits for CI to finish, then cleans up
# the tag and the draft GitHub Release that was created.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-release-workflow.nu
#   ./scripts/test-release-workflow.nu --tag v0.0.0-smoke-test
#   ./scripts/test-release-workflow.nu --no-wait   # push tag only, skip polling
#   ./scripts/test-release-workflow.nu --cleanup   # delete tag + GH release only
