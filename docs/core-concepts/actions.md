# Actions

!!! note "Go users"
    The code examples in this chapter are **Rust**. The Go action API uses separate goal-acceptance and execute callbacks instead of the `with_handler(ExecutingGoal)` pattern shown here. For Go action patterns, see the [Go Bindings](../bindings/go.md) chapter.

**Actions enable long-running tasks with progress feedback and cancellation support, perfect for operations that take seconds or minutes to complete.** Unlike services that return immediately, actions provide streaming feedback while executing complex workflows.

!!! tip
    Use actions for robot navigation, trajectory execution, or any operation where you need progress updates and the ability to cancel mid-execution. Use services for quick request-response operations.

## What is an Action?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
accTitle: ROS 2 action goal, feedback, and result sequence
accDescr: The action client sends a goal to the server, which returns acceptance then streams periodic feedback before sending the final result.
    participant C as Action Client
    participant S as Action Server

    C->>S: Goal (target_x, target_y)
    S-->>C: Accepted

    loop Executing
        S-->>C: Feedback (30%)
        S-->>C: Feedback (65%)
        S-->>C: Feedback (100%)
    end

    S-->>C: Result: Succeeded
```

**A long-running task with three channels: goal → feedback stream → result. Plus cancellation.**

- **Goal** — what the client wants done (`float64 target_x, target_y`)
- **Feedback** — progress while executing (`float64 percent_complete`)
- **Result** — final outcome when done (`float64 elapsed_seconds`)
- **Cancel** — client can abort at any time; server decides how to honor it

### When to use actions

| Operation | Duration | Use |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Drive to coordinates | 5–60 s | **Action** |
| Execute trajectory | 1–30 s | **Action** |
| Compute inverse kinematics | < 100 ms | Service |
| Publish odometry | Continuous | Topic |

### The .action format

```text
# Goal
float64 target_x
float64 target_y
---
# Result
float64 elapsed_seconds
string  status_message
---
# Feedback
float64 percent_complete
float64 current_x
float64 current_y
```

Three sections separated by `---`: goal, result, feedback.

### Goal states

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
accTitle: Action goal state machine from Pending to terminal states
accDescr: A goal moves from Pending to Accepted or Rejected, then through Executing toward Succeeded, Aborted, or Canceled via a Canceling intermediate state.
    [*] --> Pending : SendGoal
    Pending --> Accepted : server accepts
    Pending --> Rejected : server rejects
    Accepted --> Executing : execution starts
    Executing --> Succeeded : task complete
    Executing --> Aborted : server error
    Executing --> Canceling : cancel request received
    Canceling --> Canceled : server honors cancel
```

### Cancellation contract

Sending a cancel does **not** immediately stop the action:

1. Client sends cancel request
2. Server receives it — decides how/when to stop
3. Server sends `Result(status=Canceled)` to close the goal
4. Until then, the goal remains in `Executing` state

### ros-z type-state API

ros-z uses Rust's type system to enforce the action protocol at compile time:

```text
RequestedGoal  →  AcceptedGoal  →  ExecutingGoal
     ↓                                   ↓
  (reject)                          publish_feedback()
                                    return Result
```

The compiler prevents calling `publish_feedback` before `accept()`. Invalid state transitions are caught at compile time, not at runtime.

## Action Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
accTitle: Full action lifecycle including feedback and terminal states
accDescr: The action progresses from Idle through Accepted and Executing, optionally looping on feedback, before reaching Succeeded, Canceled, or Aborted.
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Accepted: Send Goal
    Accepted --> Executing: Start Processing
    Executing --> Executing: Send Feedback
    Executing --> Succeeded: Complete
    Executing --> Canceled: Cancel Request
    Executing --> Aborted: Error Occurs
    Succeeded --> [*]
    Canceled --> [*]
    Aborted --> [*]
```

## Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Goal** | Input | Defines the desired outcome |
| **Feedback** | Stream | Progress updates during execution |
| **Result** | Output | Final outcome when complete |
| **Status** | State | Current execution state |

## Communication Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
accTitle: Action communication pattern with success, cancel, and error paths
accDescr: The client sends a goal and receives feedback during execution, then one of three outcomes: Success, Canceled by client request, or Aborted on server error.
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server

    C->>S: Send Goal
    S->>C: Goal Accepted
    loop During Execution
        S->>C: Feedback Update
    end
    alt Success
        S->>C: Result (Success)
    else Canceled
        C->>S: Cancel Request
        S->>C: Result (Canceled)
    else Error
        S->>C: Result (Aborted)
    end
```

### Execution Timeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
accTitle: Detailed action execution timeline with cancellation and error
accDescr: Shows a navigation goal being sent with a goal ID, followed by periodic feedback at 25, 50, and 75 percent, ending in Succeeded, Canceled, or Aborted depending on outcome.
    participant C as Action Client
    participant S as Action Server

    C->>S: SendGoal(target_x=3.0, target_y=4.0)
    S-->>C: GoalResponse(accepted=true, goal_id=abc123)

    loop Every 500ms during execution
        S-->>C: Feedback(percent_complete=25%)
        S-->>C: Feedback(percent_complete=50%)
        S-->>C: Feedback(percent_complete=75%)
    end

    alt Normal completion
        S-->>C: Result(status=Succeeded, elapsed=12.3s)
    else Client cancels
        C->>S: CancelGoal(goal_id=abc123)
        S-->>C: CancelResponse(accepted=true)
        S-->>C: Result(status=Canceled)
    else Server error
        S-->>C: Result(status=Aborted, message="obstacle detected")
    end
```

## Use Cases

**Robot Navigation:**

- Goal: Target position and orientation
- Feedback: Current position, distance remaining, obstacles detected
- Result: Final position, success/failure reason

**Gripper Control:**

- Goal: Desired grip force and position
- Feedback: Current force, contact detection
- Result: Grip achieved, object secured

**Long Computations:**

- Goal: Computation parameters
- Feedback: Progress percentage, intermediate results
- Result: Final computed value, execution time

!!! info
    Actions excel when operations take more than a few seconds and users need visibility into progress. For sub-second operations, prefer services for simplicity.

## Minimal Pattern

Before reading the full examples, here is the skeleton every action client and server follows:

**Client:**

```rust
use ros_z::Builder;
use ros_z::context::ZContextBuilder;

let ctx = ZContextBuilder::default().build()?;
let node = ctx.create_node("my_client").build()?;

// Create the action client
let client = node
    .create_action_client::<MyAction>("my_action_name")
    .build()?;

// 1. Send a goal — returns a GoalHandle
let mut goal_handle = client.send_goal(MyAction::Goal { target: 10 }).await?;

// 2. Stream feedback while the action runs
if let Some(mut feedback_rx) = goal_handle.feedback() {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(fb) = feedback_rx.recv().await {
            println!("Progress: {:?}", fb);
        }
    });
}

// 3. Wait for the final result (blocks until terminal state)
let result = goal_handle.result().await?;
println!("Done: {:?}", result);
```

**Server:**

```rust
use ros_z::Builder;
use ros_z::action::server::ExecutingGoal;
use ros_z::context::ZContextBuilder;

let ctx = ZContextBuilder::default().build()?;
let node = ctx.create_node("my_server").build()?;

// Create the action server (keep _server alive for the duration)
let _server = node
    .create_action_server::<MyAction>("my_action_name")
    .build()?
    .with_handler(|executing: ExecutingGoal<MyAction>| async move {
        // Report progress (synchronous — no .await)
        executing.publish_feedback(MyAction::Feedback { progress: 50 }).expect("feedback failed");

        // Check for cancellation
        if executing.is_cancel_requested() {
            executing.canceled(MyAction::Result { value: 0 }).unwrap();
            return;
        }

        executing.succeed(MyAction::Result { value: 42 }).unwrap();
    });
```

The key constraint: **one `GoalHandle` per goal**. `feedback()` and `status_watch()` each return `Some` only on the first call — after that, the handle has moved out the receiver.
